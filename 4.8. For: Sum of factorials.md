# Statement
## In mathematics, the factorial of an integer n, denoted by n! is the following product:

#### n! = 1 × 2 × … × n

## For the given integer n calculate the value 

#### 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + n!

## Try to discover the solution that uses only one for-loop. And don't use math module in this exercise.

## Example input
```
4
```
## Example output
```
33
```
## Program
```
fact = 1
b  = 0
a = int(input())
for i in range(1,a+1):
  fact=fact*i
  b=b+fact
print(b)

```
