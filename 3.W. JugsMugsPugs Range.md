# INTERVIEW GRADE
## This is a frequently asked problem in technical interviews. It is also asked of senior software developers to gauge their ability to think and write clean code. 


## JugsMugsPugsPlusReverse Range
#### - Write a program that receives a number on the input and prints values from 1 to   that number subjected to the conditions below. 
#### - It also should receive another boolean value 'rev' on the input. 

## For every number in the given range, 
####  - If the number is a multiple of 3, or it contains digit 3, it prints "Jugs". 
####  - If the number is a multiple of 5, or it contains digit 5, it prints "Mugs".
####  - If the number is a multiple of 7, or it contains digit 7, it prints "Pugs".

####  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "Jugsmugs" - also if number contains 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs"
####  - If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".- also if number contains 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs"
####  - If the number is a multiple of 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".- also if number contains 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs"

#### Otherwise, it prints the number.

# REVERSE REQUIREMENT:
## If the boolean 'rev' is True, then reverse the order of printing. 
####  - "PugsJugsMugs" for multiples of 3, 5 and 7
####  - "PugsMugs" for multiple of 5 and 7
####  - "MugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 5 
####  - "PugsJugs" for multiple of 3 and 7
