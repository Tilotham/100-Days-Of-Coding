## Distance between two points
#### 
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.To find the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), all that you need to do is use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply some common sense. Begin with the most simplest formula and then incrementally arrive at the correct formula as you solve the test cases.
## 1 Do it your own way
#### Solve it the way using whatever technique works for you. 
## 2 Do it incrementally  (remember Maze 10 in Blockly?)
#### Look at the first test case - Point p1 = (0,0) and Point p2 =(4,0). If you mentally apply your mind, the answer is 4. Write the simple formula for this and past the test case.Look at the second test case - Point p1 = (4,0) and Point p2 = (0,0). The answer should again be 4. But what does your code calculate the value to? What is the one simple change you will do to make it pass Test case 1 and Test case 2?Now consider two points on the Y-axis, say (0, 2) and (0, 4). What additional line of code will you write to tackle this?And then comes the complex one: What if the points are (0, 0) and (4, 3)? First calculate in your own head, what should be the distance? What changes to the logic will you make it to match 5?
